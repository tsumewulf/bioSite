			<p>Brandon, or as he likes to be called by friends, “Jabby,” is an introvert who sometimes acts extroverted while being fascinating. In his free time, he runs a dog rescue that is a 501(c)(3) recognized charity, is a handyman around his home, and building computers for his friends or family on occasion. As for his actual job, however, he is a Biomedical Equipment Repair Technician, Imaging Service Engineer, and MRI/CT Specialist, which means if an MRI or CT machine goes down, then he’s the guy called to fix it, and he has been doing it since June of 1998. Jabby is also a recovering addict of over 20 years while also being a veteran of the United States military.</p> 
			<p>He also likes to stream various types of content, from video games to live casting, on Twitch, where he’s built up a small following and community that supports each other within it. He’s a proud father of two and is still married even though he has recently realized he is bisexual. He’s an advocate for not only the LGBTQIA+ community but the mental health community as well due to his daughter coming out as non-binary, his son being autistic, and him being diagnosed with ADHD, and this is something that he considers to be one of his biggest hobbies due to how much the issues these two communities affect him and his family. I am proud to call this man a close friend and become a part of his little community of friends and family.</p> 
	      <p>To close out this interview, I will share the motto that he claims to guide his life: “<em>Just for today, I will not anger. Just for today, I will count my blessings. Just for today, I will be good to others. Just for today, I will work honestly. Just for today.</em>”</p>
